Inspiration

Back in 2018 when SIBA visited his home village in King Williams town in Eastern Cape for Christmas holiday he failed to receive money in DAI from his friend in SWEDEN using his TILILI. So that is why we decided to create an easier and cheaper way to send and receive cash in cryptocurrencies.

What it does
It allows users to create cryptocurrency accounts using USSD platforms on a basic feature phone, send and receive funds( cryptocurrency and Fiat). Key players are users and vendors (People who have shops).

How we built it
We built it a click dummy using HTML5, CSS3, ether.js, Javascript, MakerDAO, flow.ai.

Challenges we ran into
The challenges we had was that we barely had coding skills in high level programming languages.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to come up with a working prototype

What we learned
We learn't how to to use APIs in ether.js and a user interface called flow.ai.

What's next for LIT BITS USSD
Finishing the project, test it and make accessible to everyone.
